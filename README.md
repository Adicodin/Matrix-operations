# Matrix-operations

This is a program in python made for solving the lengthy calculations given in the assignment by our college.
The assignments (attached already) asked us to :
1. Verify Cayley-Hamilton Theorem for some of the matrices. (Assignment 3)
2. Find the eigen values and eigen vectors of some matrices (Assignment 4)

This program is made with Python language.
This program does the following things :
1. Finds determinant of 2x2 and 3x3 matrix
2. Finds sum of minors of diagonals of 3x3 matrix
3. Finds characteristic equation of matrix
4. Finds roots of quadratic and cubic equation
5. Finds solution of equation with 2 and 3 variables
6. Finds eigen values and eigen vectors of matrix
7. Multiplies square matrices.
